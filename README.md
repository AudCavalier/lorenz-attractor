# lorenz-attractor
This is a quick C++ project done in school for the subject Mathematical modeling" where we wrote Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for solving Differential Equations, in this case, to solve Lorenz Equations and then graph the data.

This code generates a Data.dat file, which can be graph if the preferred graph program and see the most beautiful graph EVER
